            † SIPC insurance protects against the loss of cash and securities
            held by a customer at a financially-troubled SIPC-member brokerage
            firm. The limit of SIPC protection is $500,000, which includes a
            $250,000 limit for cash. SIPC does not protect against the decline
            in value of your securities, or losses due to bad or inappropriate
            investment advice. More information is available on the
            www.sipc.org. Customers may additionally opt into two additional
            FDIC sweep products, available through BNY Mellon's partner bank
            network and through R&T Deposit Solutions, providing $2.5M in
            extended FDIC insurance each ($5M in total insurance). FDIC coverage
            through BNY Mellon, member FDIC, protects against the loss of cash
            deposits held by a customer in the event an FDIC member bank fails.
            FDIC insurance covers all types of deposits at an insured bank but
            does not cover investments, even if they were purchased at an
            insured bank. More information is available on www.fdic.gov.
